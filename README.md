Hi my colleagues from Coursera!
My name is Martina and I am currently a student and an intern. I have done my exchange semester in the Orlando area, Florida and I was always struggeling which Restaurant to try out next. I often chose a really bad one cause I didn't know the ratings or options I had.

Therefore, I want to find out restaurants in the Orlando area and test their rating to which one to go to.

There are so many exchange students in Florida, I think that many would benefit from getting an overview of eat-out possibilities.
